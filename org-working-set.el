;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;;  Manage a small subset of org-nodes to visit them with ease.
;;
;;  On a busy day org-working-set allows to jump quickly between the nodes
;;  associated with different tasks. It provides an answer to the question:
;;  What have I been doing before beeing interrupted in the middle of an
;;  interruption ?
;;
;;  The working-set is a small set of nodes; you may add nodes (which
;;  means: their ids) to your working-set, if you want to visit them
;;  frequently; the node visited last is called the current node. The
;;  working-set is volatile and expected to change each day or even hour.
;;
;;  Once you have added nodes to your working set, there are two ways to
;;  traverse them (both accessible through the central function
;;  `org-working-set'): circling through your working set is the quickest
;;  way to return to the current node or visit others; alternatively, the
;;  working-set menu produces a editable list of all working-set nodes,
;;  allowing visits too.
;;  
;;  Please note, that org-working-set adds an id-property to all nodes in
;;  the working-set; but it does not move or change the nodes in any other
;;  way.
;;
;;  The list of ids from the nodes of your working-set is stored within the
;;  property-drawer of a distinguished node specified via
;;  `org-working-set-id'; this node will also collect an ever-growing
;;  journal of nodes added to the working-set, which may serve as a
;;  reference later.
;;
;;  Remark: Depending on your needs you might find these packages
;;  interesting too as they provide similar functionality: org-now and
;;  org-mru-clock.
;;
;;
;; Fictional User-Story:
;;
;;  Assume, you come into the office in the morning and start your emacs
;;  with org-mode, because you keep all your notes in org. Yesterday
;;  evening you only worked within the org-node 'Feature Request';
;;  therefore your working-set only contains this node (which means: its
;;  id).
;;
;;  So, you invoke the working-set menu (or even quicker, the circle) and
;;  jump to the node 'Feature Request' where you continue to work. Short
;;  after that, your Boss asks for an urgent status-report. You immediately
;;  stop work on 'Feature Request' and find your way to the neglected node
;;  'Status Report', The working set cannot help you to find this node
;;  initially, but then you add it for quicker access from now on. Your
;;  working set now contains two nodes.
;;
;;  Next you attend your scrum-meeting, which means you open the node
;;  'Daily Scrum'. You add it to your working set, because you expect to
;;  make short excursions to other nodes and want to come back quickly.
;;  After the meeting you remove its node from your working set and
;;  continue to work on 'Status Report', which you find through your
;;  working-set quickly.
;;
;;  When done with the report you have a look at your agenda, and realize
;;  that 'Organize Team-Event' is scheduled for today. So you decide to add
;;  it to your working-set (in case you get interrupted by a phone call)
;;  and start to work on this for an hour or so. The rest of the day passes
;;  like this with work, interruptions and task-switches.
;;  
;;  If this sounds like your typical work-day, you might indeed benefit
;;  from org-working-set.
;;  
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;  - org-working-set can be installed with package.el
;;  - Invoke `org-working-set', it will explain and assist in setting the
;;    customizable variable `org-working-set-id'
;;  - Optional: Bind `org-working-set' to a key, e.g. C-c w
;;

;;; Change Log:

;;   Version 2.3
;;
;;   - Renamed 'log of working-set nodes' into 'journal'
;;   - Create org-working-set-dispatch-keymap for easier customization
;;   - Reorganized keys (but you may change it if you like)
;;   - In-prompt display of settings for clock-in and land-at
;;   - Added a 'Fictional User-Story' to the documentation
;;
;;   Version 2.2
;;
;;   - Moved org-id-cleanup to its own package
;;   - Improved handling of missing ids in working set
;;   - Refactoring
;;   - Fixes
;;
;;   Version 2.1
;;
;;   - Added org-id-cleanup to clean up unreferenced IDs without attachments
;;
;;   Version 2.0
;;
;;   - Added a log of working set nodes
;;   - The node designated by org-working-set-id will be used to store this log
;;   - Simplified handling of clocking
;;   - Retired property working-set-nodes-do-not-clock
;;   - Renamed custom-variable org-working-set-clock-into-working-set into
;;     org-working-set-clock-in
;;   - Renamed org-working-set-show-working-set-overlay into
;;     org-working-set-show-overlay
;;   - Renamed org-working-set-goto-bottom-in-working-set into
;;     org-working-set-goto-bottom
;;
;;   Version 1.1
;;
;;   - Moved functions for working set into its own file
;;   - Show breadcrumbs in working-set-menu
;;   - Prepare for melpa

  "Manage a small subset of org-nodes to visit them with ease.

On a busy day org-working-set allows to jump quickly between the nodes

What have I been doing before beeing interrupted in the middle of an

The working-set is a small set of nodes; you may add nodes (which

working-set is volatile and expected to change each day or even hour.

`org-working-set'): circling through your working set is the quickest
way to return to the current node or visit others; alternatively, the
working-set menu produces a editable list of all working-set nodes,
allowing visits too.

Please note, that org-working-set adds an id-property to all nodes in
the working-set; but it does not move or change the nodes in any other
way.

The list of ids from the nodes of your working-set is stored within the
property-drawer of a distinguished node specified via
`org-working-set-id'; this node will also collect an ever-growing
journal of nodes added to the working-set, which may serve as a
reference later.

Remark: Depending on your needs you might find these packages
interesting too as they provide similar functionality: org-now and
org-mru-clock.

Fictional User-Story:

Assume, you come into the office in the morning and start your emacs
with org-mode, because you keep all your notes in org. Yesterday
evening you only worked within the org-node 'Feature Request';
therefore your working-set only contains this node (which means: its
id).

So, you invoke the working-set menu (or even quicker, the circle) and
jump to the node 'Feature Request' where you continue to work. Short

stop work on 'Feature Request' and find your way to the neglected node
'Status Report', The working set cannot help you to find this node

working set now contains two nodes.

Next you attend your scrum-meeting, which means you open the node
'Daily Scrum'. You add it to your working set, because you expect to
make short excursions to other nodes and want to come back quickly.
After the meeting you remove its node from your working set and
continue to work on 'Status Report', which you find through your
working-set quickly.

When done with the report you have a look at your agenda, and realize
that 'Organize Team-Event' is scheduled for today. So you decide to add
it to your working-set (in case you get interrupted by a phone call)
and start to work on this for an hour or so. The rest of the day passes
like this with work, interruptions and task-switches.

If this sounds like your typical work-day, you might indeed benefit
from org-working-set.

This is version 2.3.1 of org-working-set.el.


`org-working-set' is the single entry-point; its subcommands allow to:

- Modify the list of nodes (e.g. add nodes or remove others)
- Circle quickly through the nodes
- Show a menu buffer with all nodes currently in the working set
